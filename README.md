Exercises from this challenge are a mixture between beginner and advanced. I'm doing exercises from [this website](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)  where I'm randomly choosing  exercises and adding changes to them so they can be harder as well as more interesting.


## What do I want to achieve from this challenge?

My reason is pretty simple, I want to be more active on GitHub, also I want to dive deeper and learn more about JavaScript and other Frontend technologies.
