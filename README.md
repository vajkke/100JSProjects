## [Link of the website](https://vajkke.github.io/100daysCHALLENGE/) 



Exercises from this challenge are a mixture between beginner and advanced. I'm doing exercises from [this website](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)  where I'm randomly choosing  exercises and adding changes to them so they can be harder as well as more interesting.


## What do I want to achieve from this challenge?

My reason is pretty simple, I want to be more active on GitHub, also I want to dive deeper and learn more about JavaScript and other Frontend technologies.

### In the next section I will write the things I've learned or done from each exercise

## Project 1 - Countdown Counter

- Intervals & timers.
- Input manipulation


## Project 2 - Balloon Popping Game

- CSS Animation - always struggled with animation so this project was really fun
- element.remove() - very helpful js method


## Project 3 - Light/Dark Mode

- CSS transition
- Linear Gradient
- element.style.cssText - this method is like element.style ... but on steroids


## Project 4 - To-do App

- keyCodes - good for shortcuts
- DOM manipulation - basically all HTML elements came from js


## Project 5 - Background Changing

- scale - CSS is amazing, with only scale you can change the whole UI
